#Problem 1
'''
Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year 
if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required 
by the credit card company each month.

A summary of the required math is found below:

Monthly interest rate= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
Minimum monthly payment = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)
Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)
Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)
'''

month = 0
monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 12.0
for month in range(1, 13):
    minPay = monthlyPaymentRate * balance
    unpayBal = balance - minPay
    balance = unpayBal + (monthlyInterestRate * unpayBal)
    month += 1
print(' Remaining balance: ' + str(round(balance,2)))

#Problem 2
'''
Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed
 in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. 
 By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change
 each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.
 Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum fixed monthly payment)

Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)
'''

low = balance / 12.0
high = balance * (1 + annualInterestRate / 12.0) ** 12 / 12
payment = (low + high) / 2.0

while True:
    newbalance = balance
    for i in range(1, 13):
            #newbalance = (newbalance - payment) * (1 + annualInterestRate / 12.0)
        newbalance -= payment
        newbalance += (annualInterestRate / 12.0) * newbalance
    if newbalance > 0:
        low = payment
    elif newbalance <= 0 and newbalance >= -0.01:
        break
    else:
        high = payment
    payment = (low + high) / 2.0
print ('Lowest Payment:', round(fixed, 2))


#Problem 3 - Using Bisection Search to Make the Program Faster

'''
Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
Monthly payment lower bound = Balance / 12
Monthly payment upper bound = (Balance x (1 + Monthly interest rate)12) / 12.0
'''

lower = balance / 12.0
upper = balance * (1 + annualInterestRate / 12.0) ** 12 / 12
fixed = (lower + upper) / 2.0

while True:
    remain = balance
    for i in range(1, 13):
        remain = (remain - fixed) * (1 + annualInterestRate/ 12.0)
    if remain > 0:
        lower = fixed
    elif remain <= 0 and remain >= -0.01:
        break
    else:
        upper = fixed
    fixed = (lower + upper) / 2.0
    
print ('Lowest Payment:', round(fixed, 2))
