# Hangman
'''
Now you will implement the function hangman,
 which takes one parameter - the secretWord the user is to guess.
 This starts up an interactive game of Hangman between the user 
 and the computer. Be sure you take advantage of the three helper functions,
 isWordGuessed, getGuessedWord, and getAvailableLetters,
 that you've defined in the previous part.
